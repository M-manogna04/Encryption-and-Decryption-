# Encryption and Decryption
Python Message Encode-Decode to Secure your Information by Encoding the messages
Encoding is the process that transforms the text or information to the unrecognizable form and decryption is the process to convert the encrypted message into original form.

# Message Encode and Decode
Message encoding and decoding is the process of converting the original text to ciphertext, which is a random and meaningless text. Encoding is the term for this procedure. The process of converting that ciphertext to the original text is known as decoding. The Encryption-Decryption process is another name for this procedure.

# Downloading and installing python modules
To build this project we will use basic concept of python, Tkinter, and base64 library.
To install the library we use pip install command on the command prompt
